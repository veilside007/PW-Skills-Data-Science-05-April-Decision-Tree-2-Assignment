    "7. **Error Analysis**: Analyze the types of errors made by the decision tree model, such as false positives and false negatives. Investigate the characteristics of misclassified instances to gain insights into areas where the model may need improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop to continuously monitor and update the decision tree model's performance over time. Collect feedback from stakeholders, clinicians, or end-users to identify issues or areas for improvement and iteratively refine the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can validate the decision tree model, assess its robustness, and gain insights into its performance in different scenarios and environments. This validation process helps ensure that the model is reliable and effective for identifying patients with diabetes based on clinical variables."
